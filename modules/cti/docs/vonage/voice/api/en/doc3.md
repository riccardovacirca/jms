# NCCO reference

A Call Control Object (NCCO) is represented by a JSON array. You can use it to control the flow of a Voice API call. For your NCCO to execute correctly, the JSON objects must be valid.

While developing and testing NCCOs, you can use the Voice Playground to try out NCCOs interactively. You can [read more about it in the Voice API Overview](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/technical-details#voice-playground) or [go directly to the Voice Playground in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/playground).

## NCCO actions

The order of actions in the NCCO controls the flow of the Call. Actions that have to complete before the next action can be executed are *synchronous*. Other actions are *asynchronous*. That is, they are supposed to continue over the following actions until a condition is met. For example, a `record` action terminates when the `endOnSilence` option is met. When all the actions in the NCCO are complete, the Call ends.

The NCCO actions and the options and types for each action are:

| Action | Description | Synchronous |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [record](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#record) | All or part of a Call | No |
| [conversation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#conversation) | Create or join an existing [Conversation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/conversation/concepts/conversation) | Yes |
| [connect](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#connect) | To a connectable endpoint such as a phone number or VBC extension. | Yes |
| [talk](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#talk) | Send synthesized speech to a Conversation. | Yes, unless bargeIn=true |
| [stream](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#stream) | Send audio files to a Conversation. | Yes, unless bargeIn=true |
| [input](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#input) | Collect digits or capture speech input from the person you are calling. | Yes |
| [notify](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#notify) | Send a request to your application to track progress through an NCCO | Yes |
| [wait](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#wait) | Pause execution for a specified number of seconds | Yes |
| [transfer](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#transfer) | Move the call legs from a current conversation into another existing conversation | Yes |

> Note: Connect an inbound call provides an example of how to serve your NCCOs to Vonage after a Call or Conference is initiated.

**Note that in all actions, the `eventUrl` parameter MUST be an array, even if it only contains a single value.**

## Record

Use the `record` action to record a Call or part of a Call:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "record",
    "eventUrl": ["https://example.com/recordings"]
  },
  {
    "action": "connect",
    "eventUrl": ["https://example.com/events"],
    "from":"447700900000",
    "endpoint": [
      {
        "type": "phone",
        "number": "447700900001"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The record action is asynchronous. You can define a synchronous condition - `endOnSilence`, `timeOut` or `endOnKey` - to finish the recording when it is met. If no condition is set, the record will work in an asynchronous manner and will instantly continue on to the next action while still recording the call. The recording will only end and send the relevant event when the call is ended. This is used for scenarios similar to call monitoring.

You can transcribe a recording using the `transcription` [option](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#transcription-settings). Once the recording's transcription is complete, a callback will be sent to an `eventUrl`. Using the transcription settings you can specify a custom `eventUrl` and `language` for your transcriptions. Please note, this is a chargeable feature; exact rates can be found on the [Voice API Pricing](https://www.vonage.co.uk/communications-apis/voice/pricing/) page under 'Programmable Features'.

For information about the workflow to follow, see [Recording](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/recording).

You can use the following options to control a `record` action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `format` | Record the Call in a specific format. Options are:mp3wavoggThe default value is `mp3`, or `wav` when recording more than 2 channels. | No |
| `split` | Record the sent and received audio in separate channels of a stereo recording—set to `conversation` to enable this. | No |
| `channels` | The number of channels to record (maximum `32`). If the number of participants exceeds `channels` any additional participants will be added to the last channel in file. split `conversation` must also be enabled. | No |
| `endOnSilence` | Stop recording after n seconds of silence. Once the recording is stopped the recording data is sent to `event_url`. The range of possible values is 3<=`endOnSilence`<=10. | No |
| `endOnKey` | Stop recording when a digit is pressed on the handset. Possible values are: `*`, `#` or any single digit e.g. `9`. | No |
| `timeOut` | The maximum length of a recording in seconds. One the recording is stopped the recording data is sent to `event_url`. The range of possible values is between `3` seconds and `7200` seconds (2 hours). | No |
| `beepStart` | Set to `true` to play a beep when a recording starts. | No |
| `eventUrl` | The URL to the webhook endpoint that is called asynchronously when a recording is finished. If the message recording is hosted by Vonage, this webhook contains the [URL you need to download the recording and other meta data](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#record-return-parameters). | No |
| `eventMethod` | The HTTP method used to make the request to `eventUrl`. The default value is `POST`. | No |
| `transcription` [Beta] | Set to an empty object, `{}`, to use the default values or customize with [Transcription Settings](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#transcription-settings) | No |

### Transcription Settings

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | The language ([BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) format) for the recording you're transcribing. This currently supports the same languages as Automatic Speech Recording, and a list is available [here](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/asr#language). | No |
| `eventUrl` | The URL to the webhook endpoint that is called asynchronously when a transcription is finished. | No |
| `eventMethod` | The HTTP method Vonage uses to make the request to eventUrl. The default value is `POST`. | No |
| `sentimentAnalysis` [[Developer Preview]](https://developer.vonage.com/en/product-lifecycle/dev-preview) | Perform sentiment analysis on the call recording transcription segments. Will return a value between -1 (negative sentiment) and 1 (positive sentiment) for each segment. Defaults to `false`. | No |

> Please Note: there is a 2 hour maximum limit for transcribing voice calls.

### Record Return Parameters

See the [Webhook Reference](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#record) for record or transcription parameters which are returned to the `eventUrl`.

## Conversation

You can use the `conversation` action to create standard or moderated conferences, while preserving the communication context. Using `conversation` with the same `name` reuses the same persisted [Conversation](https://developer.vonage.com/en/conversation/concepts/conversation). The first person to call the virtual number assigned to the conversation creates it. This action is synchronous.

> Note: you can invite up to 200 people to your Conversation.

The following NCCO examples show how to configure different types of Conversation. You can use the `answer_url` webhook GET request parameters to ensure you deliver one NCCO to participants and another to the moderator.

### Standard conference

```json
[
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "nexmo-conference-standard",
    "record": true,
    "transcription": {
      "eventUrl": [ "https://example.com/transcription" ],
      "eventMethod": "POST",
      "language": "he-IL"
    }
  }
]
```

### Selective Audio Controls

```javascript
// As the customer is the first person to join, there is no canHear/canSpeak entry
// The customer's leg ID is 6a4d6af0-55a6-4667-be90-8614e4c8e83c
[
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "selective-audio-demo",
    "startOnEnter": false,
    "musicOnHoldUrl": ["https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/assets/voice_api_audio_streaming.mp3"],
  }
]

// The agent joins and can both hear, and speak to the customer
// The agent's leg ID is 533c0874-f43d-446c-a153-f35bf30783fa
[
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "selective-audio-demo",
    "startOnEnter": true,
    "record": true,
    "canHear": ["6a4d6af0-55a6-4667-be90-8614e4c8e83c"], // Customer leg ID
    "canSpeak": ["6a4d6af0-55a6-4667-be90-8614e4c8e83c"] // Customer leg ID
  }
]

// Finally, the supervisor joins the conversation. They can hear both the customer
// and the agent, but only speak to the agent
// The supervisor's leg ID is e2833e43-db39-4c1a-b689-d17ad2cf3529
[
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "selective-audio-demo",
    "startOnEnter": true,
    "record": true,
    "canHear": ["6a4d6af0-55a6-4667-be90-8614e4c8e83c", "533c0874-f43d-446c-a153-f35bf30783fa"] // Customer leg ID, Agent leg ID
    "canSpeak": ["533c0874-f43d-446c-a153-f35bf30783fa"] // Agent leg ID
  }
]
```

### Moderated conference, moderator

```json
[
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "nexmo-conference-moderated",
    "record": true,
    "startOnEnter": true
  }
]
```

### Moderated conference, attendee

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Welcome to a Vonage moderated conference. We will connect you when an agent is available"
  },
  {
    "action": "conversation",
    "name": "nexmo-conference-moderated",
    "startOnEnter": false,
    "musicOnHoldUrl": ["https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/assets/voice_api_audio_streaming.mp3"]
  }
]
```

You can use the following options to control a *conversation* action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | The name of the Conversation room. Names are namespaced to the application level and [region](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/concepts/regions?source=voice). | Yes |
| `musicOnHoldUrl` | A URL to the mp3 file to stream to participants until the conversation starts. By default the conversation starts when the first person calls the virtual number associated with your Voice app. To stream this mp3 before the moderator joins the conversation, set startOnEnter to false for all users other than the moderator. | No |
| `startOnEnter` | The default value of true ensures that the conversation starts when this caller joins conversation `name`. Set to false for attendees in a moderated conversation. | No |
| `endOnExit` | Specifies whether a moderated conversation ends when the moderator hangs up. This is set to false by default, which means that the conversation only ends when the last remaining participant hangs up, regardless of whether the moderator is still on the call. Set `endOnExit` to true to terminate the conversation when the moderator hangs up. | No |
| `record` | Set to true to record this conversation. For standard conversations, recordings start when one or more attendees connects to the conversation. For moderated conversations, recordings start when the moderator joins. That is, when an NCCO is executed for the named conversation where startOnEnter is set to true. When the recording is terminated, the URL you download the recording from is sent to the event URL. You can override the default recording event URL and default HTTP method by providing custom `eventUrl` and `eventMethod` options in the `conversation` action definition. By default audio is recorded in MP3 format. See the [recording](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/recording#file-formats) guide for more details. | No |
| `canSpeak` | A list of leg UUIDs that this participant can be heard by. If not provided, the participant can be heard by everyone. If an empty list is provided, the participant will not be heard by anyone | No |
| `canHear` | A list of leg UUIDs that this participant can hear. If not provided, the participant can hear everyone. If an empty list is provided, the participant will not hear any other participants | No |
| `mute` | Set to true to mute the participant. The audio from the participant will not be played to the conversation and will not be recorded. When using `canSpeak`, the `mute` parameter is not supported. | No |
| `transcription` | Transcription settings. If presented (even as empty object), transcription is activated. The record parameter must be set to true. See [Transcription Settings](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#transcription-settings) above for more details. | No |

## Connect

You can use the `connect` action to connect a call to endpoints such as phone numbers or a VBC extension.

This action is synchronous, after a *connect* the next action in the NCCO stack is processed. A connect action ends when the endpoint you are calling is busy or unavailable. You ring endpoints sequentially by nesting connect actions.

The following NCCO examples show how to configure different types of connections.

### Phone endpoint

You can use the following options to control a `connect` action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `endpoint` | Array of `endpoint` objects to connect to. Currently supports a maximum of one `endpoint` object. [Available endpoint types](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#endpoint-types-and-values). | Yes |
| `from` | A number in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format that identifies the caller. This must be one of your Vonage virtual numbers if you're connecting to a real phone, as the call won't connect otherwise. | No |
| `randomFromNumber` | Set to `true` to use a random phone number as `from`. The number will be selected from the list of the numbers assigned to the current application. The application will try to use number(s) from the same country as the destination (if available). `randomFromNumber: true` cannot be used together with `from`. The default value is `false`. | No |
| `eventType` | Set to `synchronous` to:make the connect action synchronousenable eventUrl to return an NCCO that overrides the current NCCO when a call moves to specific states. | No |
| `timeout` | If the call is unanswered, set the number in seconds before Vonage stops ringing `endpoint`. Must be an integer between `1` and `120`. The default value is `60`. | No |
| `limit` | Maximum length of the call in seconds. The default and maximum value is `7200` seconds (2 hours). | No |
| `machineDetection` | Configure the behavior when Vonage detects that a destination is an answerphone. Set to either:continue - Vonage sends an HTTP request to event_url with the Call event machinehangup - end the Call | No |
| `advancedMachineDetection` | Configure the behavior of Vonage's advanced machine detection. Overrides `machineDetection` if both are set. See the [API reference](https://developer.vonage.com/en/api/voice#createCall) for parameter details. This feature is chargeable; exact rates can be found on the [Voice API Pricing](https://www.vonage.co.uk/communications-apis/voice/pricing/) page under 'Programmable Features'. | No |
| `eventUrl` | Set the webhook endpoint that Vonage calls asynchronously on each of the possible [Call States](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/call-flow#call-states). If `eventType` is set to `synchronous` the `eventUrl` can return an NCCO that overrides the current NCCO when a timeout occurs. | No |
| `eventMethod` | The HTTP method Vonage uses to make the request to eventUrl. The default value is `POST`. | No |
| `ringbackTone` | A URL value that points to a `ringbackTone` to be played back on repeat to the caller, so they don't hear silence. The `ringbackTone` will automatically stop playing when the call is fully connected. It's not recommended to use this parameter when connecting to a phone endpoint, as the carrier will supply their own `ringbackTone`. Example: `"ringbackTone": "http://example.com/ringbackTone.wav"`. | No |

### Endpoint Types and Values

#### Phone (PSTN) - phone numbers in E.164 format

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The endpoint type: `phone` for a PSTN endpoint. |
| `number` | The phone number to connect to in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. |
| `dtmfAnswer` | Set the digits that are sent to the user as soon as the Call is answered. The `*` and `#` digits are respected. You create pauses using `p`. Each pause is 500ms. |
| `onAnswer` | A JSON object containing a required `url` key. The URL serves an NCCO to execute in the number being connected to, before that call is joined to your existing conversation. Optionally, the `ringbackTone` key can be specified with a URL value that points to a `ringbackTone` to be played back on repeat to the caller, so they do not hear just silence. The `ringbackTone` will automatically stop playing when the call is fully connected. Example: `{"url":"https://example.com/answer", "ringbackTone":"http://example.com/ringbackTone.wav" }`. Please note, the key `ringback` is still supported. |
| `shaken` | For Vonage customers who are required by the FCC to sign their own calls to the USA, we offer the option to place Voice API calls using your own signature.  This feature is available by request only. Calls with an invalid signature will be rejected. Please contact us for further information.  When using this option, you must place the STIR/SHAKEN Identity Header content that Vonage must use for this call. The expected format consists of:a JWT with the header, payload, and signaturean info parameter with a link to the certificatean alg (algorithm) parameter indicating the encryption type useda ppt (passport type) parameter that should be shakenRefer to the example provided below the table. |

  

Example of the `shaken` option:

| --- | --- |
| `type` | The endpoint type: `app` for an [application](https://developer.vonage.com/en/client-sdk/setup/create-your-application). |
| `user` | The username of the user to connect to. This username must have been [added as a user](https://developer.vonage.com/en/api/conversation#createUser). |

#### WebSocket - the WebSocket to connect to

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The endpoint type: `sip` for SIP. |
| `uri` | The SIP URI to the endpoint you are connecting to in the format `sip:rebekka@sip.example.com`. To use [TLS and/or SRTP](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/sip/overview#protocols), include respectively `transport=tls` or `media=srtp` to the URL with the semicolon `;` as a delimiter, for example: `sip:rebekka@sip.example.com;transport=tls;media=srtp`. Note that this property is mutually exclusive with `user` and `domain`. |
| `user` | The `user` component of the URI. It will be used along the `domain` property to create the full SIP URI. If you set this property, you must also set `domain` and leave `uri` unset. |
| `domain` | The identifier for a trunk created using the dashboard. This must be a successfully provisioned domain using the [SIP Trunking dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/sip-trunking) or the [Programmable SIP API](https://developer.vonage.com/en/api/psip#createDomain). The URIs provisioned in the trunk will be used along the `user` property to create the full SIP URI. So for example, if the URI in the trunk is: `sip.example.com` and `user` is `example_user`, Vonage will send the call to `example_user@sip.example.com`. If you set this property, you must leave `uri` unset. Note that this property refers to the domain name, not the domain URI. |
| `headers` | `key` => `value` string pairs containing any metadata you need e.g. `{ "location": "New York City", "occupation": "developer" }`. The headers are transmitted as part of the SIP INVITE as `X-key: value` headers. So in the example, these headers are sent: `X-location: New York City` and `X-occupation: developer`. |
| `standardHeaders` | A JSON object containing a single key `User-to-User`. This is used to transmit user-to-user information if supported by the vendor, as per [RFC 7433](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7433). Unlike `headers`, the key will not be prepended with `X-`, since it is standardised. For example: `{ "User-to-User": "342342ef34;encoding=hex" }`. Vonage will not validate the content of the User-to-User header, other than making sure it using valid characters and that the content is within the maximum number of characters permitted (256). |

> To understand how your application can receive and handle SIP Custom Headers instead, check the following page on Programmable SIP. If you would like to know how your application can send SIP Headers, go to the Voice API Webhooks Reference Guide.

#### VBC - the Vonage Business Cloud (VBC) extension to connect to

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `type` | The endpoint type: `vbc` for a VBC extension. |
| `extension` | the VBC extension to connect the call to. |

## Talk

The `talk` action sends synthesized speech to a Conversation.

The text provided in the talk action can either be plain, or formatted using [SSML](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/concepts/customizing-tts). SSML tags provide further instructions to the text-to-speech synthesizer which allow you to set pitch, pronunciation and to combine together text in multiple languages. SSML tags are XML-based and sent inline in the JSON string.

By default, the talk action is synchronous. However, if you set *bargeIn* to *true* you must set an *input* action later in the NCCO stack. The following NCCO examples shows how to send a synthesized speech message to a Conversation or Call:

### Synchronous

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "You are listening to a Call made with Voice API"
  }
]
```

### Asynchronous

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Welcome to a Voice API I V R. ",
    "language": "en-GB",
    "bargeIn": false
  },
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Press 1 for maybe and 2 for not sure followed by the hash key",
    "language": "en-GB",
    "bargeIn": true
  },
  {
    "action": "input",
    "submitOnHash": true,
    "eventUrl": ["https://example.com/ivr"]
  }
]
```

### Synchronous (with SSML)

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "<speak><prosody rate='fast'>I can speak fast.</prosody></speak>"
  }
]
```

You can use the following options to control a *talk* action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text` | A string of up to 1,500 characters (excluding SSML tags) containing the message to be synthesized in the Call or Conversation. A single comma in `text` adds a short pause to the synthesized speech. To add a longer pause a `break` tag needs to be used in SSML. To use [SSML](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/concepts/customizing-tts) tags, you must enclose the text in a `speak` element. | Yes |
| `bargeIn` | Set to `true` so this action is terminated when the user interacts with the application either with DTMF or ASR voice input. Use this feature to enable users to choose an option without having to listen to the whole message in your [Interactive Voice Response (IVR)](https://developer.vonage.com/voice/voice-api/guides/interactive-voice-response). If you set `bargeIn` to `true` the next non-talk action in the NCCO stack must be an `input` action. The default value is `false`.  Once `bargeIn` is set to `true` it will stay `true` (even if `bargeIn: false` is set in a following action) until an `input` action is encountered | No |
| `loop` | The number of times `text` is repeated before the Call is closed. The default value is 1. Set to 0 to loop infinitely. | No |
| `level` | The volume level that the speech is played. This can be any value between `-1` to `1` with `0` being the default. | No |
| `language` | The language ([BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) format) for the message you are sending. Default: `en-US`. Possible values are listed in the [Text-To-Speech guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#supported-languages). | No |
| `style` | The vocal style (vocal range, tessitura and timbre). Default: `0`. Possible values are listed in the [Text-To-Speech guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#supported-languages). | No |
| `premium` | Set to `true` to use the premium version of the specified style if available, otherwise the standard version will be used. The default value is `false`. You can find more information about Premium Voices in the [Text-To-Speech guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#premium-voices). | No |

### Talk Return Parameters

See [Webhook Reference](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#talk--stream) for the parameters which are returned to the `eventUrl`.

## Stream

The `stream` action allows you to send an audio stream to a Conversation

By default, the stream action is synchronous. However, if you set *bargeIn* to *true* you must set an *input* action later in the NCCO stack.

The following NCCO example shows how to send an audio stream to a Conversation or Call:

### Synchronous

```json
[
  {
    "action": "stream",
    "streamUrl": ["https://acme.com/streams/music.mp3"]
  }
]
```

### Asynchronous

```json
[
  {
    "action": "stream",
    "streamUrl": ["https://acme.com/streams/announcement.mp3"],
    "bargeIn": "true"
  },
  {
    "action": "input",
    "submitOnHash": "true",
    "eventUrl": ["https://example.com/ivr"]
  }
]
```

You can use the following options to control a *stream* action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `streamUrl` | An array containing a single URL to an mp3 or wav (16-bit) audio file to stream to the Call or Conversation. | Yes |
| `level` | Set the audio level of the stream in the range -1 >=level<=1 with a precision of 0.1. The default value is 0. | No |
| `bargeIn` | Set to `true` so this action is terminated when the user interacts with the application either with DTMF or ASR voice input. Use this feature to enable users to choose an option without having to listen to the whole message in your [Interactive Voice Response (IVR](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/guides/interactive-voice-response) ). If you set `bargeIn` to `true` on one more Stream actions then the next non-stream action in the NCCO stack must be an `input` action. The default value is `false`.  Once `bargeIn` is set to `true` it will stay `true` (even if `bargeIn: false` is set in a following action) until an `input` action is encountered. | No |
| `loop` | The number of times `audio` is repeated before the Call is closed. The default value is `1`. Set to `0` to loop infinitely. | No |

The audio stream referred to should be a file in MP3 or WAV format. If you have issues with the file playing, please encode it to the following technical specification: [What kind of prerecorded audio files can I use?](https://api.support.vonage.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007447567)

> If you play the same audio file multiple times, for example using the same recording in many calls, consider adding a Cache-Control header to the URL response with proper values.widgets.copyCache-Control: public, max-age=360000
This allows Vonage to cache your audio file instead of downloading it each time, which may significantly improve performance and user experience. Caching is supported for both HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

### Stream Return Parameters

See [Webhook Reference](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#talk--stream) for the parameters which are returned to the `eventUrl`.

## Input

You can use the `input` action to collect digits or speech input by the person you are calling. This action is synchronous, Vonage processes the input and forwards it in the [parameters](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#input-return-parameters) sent to the `eventUrl` webhook endpoint you configure in your request. Your webhook endpoint should return another NCCO that replaces the existing NCCO and controls the Call based on the user input. You could use this functionality to create an Interactive Voice Response (IVR). For example, if your user presses *4* or says "Sales", you return a [connect](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#connect) NCCO that forwards the call to your sales department.

The following NCCO example shows how to configure an IVR endpoint:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Please enter a digit or say something"
  },
  {
    "action": "input",
    "eventUrl": [
      "https://example.com/ivr"
    ],
    "type": [ "dtmf", "speech" ],
    "dtmf": {
      "maxDigits": 1
    },
    "speech": {
      "context": [ "sales", "support" ]
    }
  }
]
```

The following NCCO example shows how to use `bargeIn` to allow a user to interrupt a `talk` action. Note that an `input` action **must** follow any action that has a `bargeIn` property (e.g. `talk` or `stream`).

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Please enter a digit or say something",
    "bargeIn": true
  },
  {
    "action": "input",
    "eventUrl": [
      "https://example.com/ivr"
    ],
    "type": [ "dtmf", "speech" ],	
    "dtmf": {
      "maxDigits": 1
    },
    "speech": {
      "context": [ "sales", "support" ]
    }	
  }
]
```

The following options can be used to control an `input` action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | Acceptable input type, can be set as `[ "dtmf" ]` for DTMF input only, `[ "speech" ]` for ASR only, or `[ "dtmf", "speech" ]` for both. | Yes |
| `dtmf` | [DTMF settings](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#dtmf-input-settings). | No |
| `speech` | [Speech recognition settings](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#speech-recognition-settings). | No |
| `mode` | Input processing mode, currently only applicable to DTMF. Valid values are `synchronous` (the default) and `asynchronous`. If set to `asynchronous`, all [DTMF settings](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#dtmf-input-settings) must be left blank. In asynchronous mode, digits are sent one at a time to the event webhook in real time. In the default `synchronous` mode, this is controlled by the DTMF settings instead and the inputs are sent in batch. | No |
| `eventUrl` | Vonage sends the digits pressed by the callee to this URL 1) after `timeOut` pause in activity or when # is pressed for DTMF or 2) after user stops speaking or `30` seconds of speech for speech input. | No |
| `eventMethod` | The HTTP method used to send event information to `event_url` The default value is `POST`. | No |

#### DTMF Input Settings

*Note:* These settings do not apply if the `mode` is set to `asynchronous`.

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeOut` | The result of the callee's activity is sent to the `eventUrl` webhook endpoint `timeOut` seconds after the last action. The default value is 3. Max is 10. | No |
| `maxDigits` | The number of digits the user can press. The maximum value is `20`, the default is `4` digits. | No |
| `submitOnHash` | Set to `true` so the callee's activity is sent to your webhook endpoint at `eventUrl` after they press #. If # is not pressed the result is submitted after `timeOut` seconds. The default value is `false`. That is, the result is sent to your webhook endpoint after `timeOut` seconds. | No |

#### Speech Recognition Settings

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uuid` | The unique ID of the Call leg for the user to capture the speech of, defined as an array with a single element. The first joined leg of the call by default. | No |
| `endOnSilence` | Controls how long the system will wait after user stops speaking to decide the input is completed. The default value is `2.0` (seconds). The range of possible values is between `0.4` seconds and `10.0` seconds. | No |
| `language` | Expected language of the user's speech. Format: BCP-47. Default: `en-US`. [List of supported languages](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/asr#language). | No |
| `context` | Array of hints (strings) to improve recognition quality if certain words are expected from the user. | No |
| `startTimeout` | Controls how long the system will wait for the user to start speaking. The range of possible values is between 1 second and 60 seconds. The default value is `10`. | No |
| `maxDuration` | Controls maximum speech duration (from the moment user starts speaking). The default value is 60 (seconds). The range of possible values is between 1 and 60 seconds. | No |
| `saveAudio` | Set to `true` so the speech input recording (`recording_url`) is sent to your webhook endpoint at `eventUrl`. The default value is `false`. | No |
| `sensitivity` | Audio sensitivity used to differentiate noise from speech. An integer value where 10 represents low sensitivity and 100 maximum sensitivity. Default is 90. | No |

The following example shows the parameters sent to the `eventUrl` webhook for DTMF input:

```json
{
  "speech": { "results": [ ] },
  "dtmf": {
    "digits": "1234",
    "timed_out": true
  },
  "from": "15551234567",
  "to": "15557654321",
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "bbbbbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee-0123456789ab",
  "timestamp": "2020-01-01T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The following example shows the parameters sent back to the `eventUrl` webhook for speech input:

```json
{
  "speech": {
    "recording_url": "https://api-us.nexmo.com/v1/files/eeeeeee-ffff-0123-4567-0123456789ab",
    "timeout_reason": "end_on_silence_timeout",
    "results": [
      {
        "confidence": "0.9405097",
        "text": "sales"
      },
      {
        "confidence": "0.70543784",
        "text": "sails"
      },
      {
        "confidence": "0.5949854",
        "text": "sale"
      }
    ]
  },
  "dtmf": {
    "digits": null,
    "timed_out": false
  },
  "from": "15551234567",
  "to": "15557654321",  
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "bbbbbbbb-cccc-dddd-eeee-0123456789ab",
  "timestamp": "2020-01-01T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Input Return Parameters

See [Webhook Reference](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/webhook-reference#input) for input parameters which are returned to the `eventUrl`.

## Notify

Use the `notify` action to send a custom payload to your event URL. Your webhook endpoint can return another NCCO that replaces the existing NCCO or return an empty payload meaning the existing NCCO will continue to execute.

```json
[
  {
    "action": "notify",
    "payload": {
      "foo": "bar"
    },
    "eventUrl": [
      "https://example.com/webhooks/event"
    ],
    "eventMethod": "POST"
  }
]
```

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `payload` | The JSON body to send to your event URL. | Yes |
| `eventUrl` | The URL to send events to. If you return an NCCO when you receive a notification, it will replace the current NCCO. | Yes |
| `eventMethod` | The HTTP method to use when sending `payload` to your `eventUrl`. | No |

### Prompts Voice Settings

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | The language ([BCP-47](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47) format) for the prompts. Default: `en-US`. Possible values are listed in the [Text-To-Speech guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#supported-languages). | No |
| `style` | The vocal style (vocal range, tessitura and timbre). Default: `0`. Possible values are listed in the [Text-To-Speech guide](https://developer.vonage.com/en/voice/voice-api/guides/text-to-speech#supported-languages). | No |

## Wait

You can use the `wait` action to add a wait period and pause execution of the running NCCO for a specified number of seconds.

The action is synchronous. The wait period starts when the wait action is executed in the NCCO and ends after the provided or default timeout value. At this point, the NCCO resumes execution. The `timeout` parameter is a float. Valid values range from 0.1 seconds to 7200 seconds. Values below 0.1 default to 0.1 seconds, and values above 7200 default to 7200 seconds. If not specified, it defaults to 10 seconds.

> Note: if you need a callback informing that the wait action ended, add a notify action after the wait action.

The following NCCO example shows how to execute the wait action:

```json
[
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "Welcome to a Vonage moderated conference"
  },
  {
    "action": "wait",
    "timeout": 0.5
  },
  {
    "action": "talk",
    "text": "We will connect you when an agent is available"
  }
]
```

You can use the following options to control a `wait` action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `timeout` | Controls the duration of the wait period before executing the next action in the NCCO. This parameter is a float. Valid values range from 0.1 seconds to 7200 seconds. Values below 0.1 default to 0.1 seconds, and values above 7200 default to 7200 seconds. The default value is `10`. | No |

## Transfer

The `transfer` action is synchronous. You can use it to move the call legs from a current conversation into another existing conversation. The `transfer` action is terminal for the current conversation, and the target conversation's NCCO continues to control the target conversation behaviour. All legs of the current conversation are transferred into the target conversation, respecting the audio settings (`canHear`, `canSpeak`, `mute`) if they’re provided.

The following NCCO example shows how to execute the transfer action:

```json
[
   ...
   {
     "action": "transfer",
     "conversationId": "CON-f972836a-550f-45fa-956c-12a2ab5b7d22",
     "canHear": [ "9c132730-8c22-4760-a4dc-40502f05b444" ]
   }
   ...
]
```

You can use the following options to control a transfer action:

| Option | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conversation_id` | Target conversation ID, defined as string. | Yes |
| `canHear` | A list of leg UUIDs that this participant can hear, defined as an array of strings. If not provided, the participant can hear everyone. If an empty list is provided, the participant will not hear any other participants. | No |
| `canSpeak` | A list of leg UUIDs that this participant can be heard by, defined as an array of strings. If not provided, the participant can be heard by everyone. If an empty list is provided, the participant will not be heard by anyone. | No |
| `mute` | Set to true to mute the participant. The audio from the participant will not be played to the conversation and will not be recorded. When using `canSpeak`, the `mute` parameter is not supported. | No |
